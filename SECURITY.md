# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is currently maintained on the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability:

- Please **do not open a public issue** with details that could be exploited.
- Instead, contact the maintainer with:
  - A description of the issue and impact
  - Steps to reproduce (PoC if possible)
  - Affected versions / commit hash

If you are not sure how to contact the maintainer, open an issue with a short note like “security contact requested” **without** vulnerability details, and we will follow up.
